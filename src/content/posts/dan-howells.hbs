<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>Tell us a little bit about what you do</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
	What I do seems to change from project-to-project: sometimes I help design agencies and clients with just the development or their web projects, sometimes I take on just the design element, and in other cases I do both the design and development. Projects range from websites, to prototyping web products and mobile apps, across all different sorts of industries.
</p>

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>How did you get into the industry?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
{{!--   In a very roundabout way. I taught myself web design and development way back in the dark ages when dot coms were teetering on the edge of catastrophe.<br><br> --}}

  In 2000 some friends and I decided to launch our own startup, called What Happened Last Night. As the name suggests it was the precursor to the likes of Facebook and Thrillist, when people didn’t have their own digital cameras with which to share the messy details of their nights out. We’d take photos and upload them onto a website for people to see and buy prints of the next day.<br><br>

  It turned out we didn’t know anyone who could design or make websites, so I volunteered. It was a fascinating experience full of ups and downs, but I didn’t go into the industry immediately afterwards since it wasn’t even an industry as we know it today (most people didn’t even have email addresses). I walked a wobbly road through advertising, management consulting, and investment banking before realising I hated all those things; the only thing I enjoyed was the web stuff that I was doing in my spare time. In about 2008 I joined <a href="http://www.YCN.org">YCN.org</a> on a full time contract basis, and then in 2009 I became a freelancer/agency-of-one with my own clients.
</p>

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>Did you ever want to join an agency?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  I’m sometimes envious of the work that a large group of really talented people can execute, but I've heard horror stories of the late nights, constant pitching, and politics that puts me off as quickly as it intrigues me. I spent about 6 weeks at a large agency where I glimpsed this, and it wasn’t at all what I’d like to do full time.
</p>

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>What about joining a startup?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  Oh, absolutely, but there are two problems: most startup ideas are terrible (especially in London), and the really good ideas appear to have sprung out of nowhere. I’m also not close enough to the startup scene to hear about very early stage startups. To counter the FOMO, I often talk to friends who have joined startups, and more often than not they are badly organised and chaotic, with only a small chance of success. The grass is always greener, not helped by the likes of Twitter and things like Product Hunt.

  <span>What made you set up on your own?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  In 2009, I set up a web design blog called siteinspire.com. It was only ever supposed to be a visual bookmarking tool for sites that I loved, but it began to get popular and suddenly it had garnered a large audience. I got two lines of enquiry via it: clients who were looking for websites, and other designers and developers who were looking to collaborate. So with a pipeline of potential clients I jumped into the unknown, and it went from there.

{{!-- <p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>What kind of work did you want to do?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  When I started as an independent, I really didn’t care. I took on some dreadful projects just because I was panicking about making money. Luckily I needn’t have worried, and started to become more picky about what I took on. As an independent though it is often really difficult to say no to projects, and is a skill in itself; one that I’m still trying to master.<br><br>

  The strange thing about the industry is that what people want to do seems to shift weekly, as new kinds of products and technology appear and disappear. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who knows precisely what they want to do.
</p> --}}

{{!-- <p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>Has the reality of being independent matched your expectations?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  Pretty much. I’ve only had one year of full time employment in this industry, so I actually didn't have many expectations or preconceptions versus someone who might have spent a decade in an advertising agency. I do know, however, that anything is better than what I was doing when I was a full time employee of a bank!
</p> --}}

{{!-- <p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>What are you working on now?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  Apart from various client projects, I’m always working on one or two side projects. I often don’t finish them but that is okay. I use side projects as ways to learn a new technology, or try out some ideas. I always try to work on ideas that help me with something: I’m working on a tool to manage my own creative contacts, and also a short-form blogging system (somewhere between Twitter and Medium).
</p> --}}

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>By working for yourself, can you have the best of both agency and startup worlds?<span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  Its sometimes easy to forget it but the flexibility and freedom of how and when I work is insanely good. For instance, I’ve deliberately had a quiet month with few stressful projects. I can pick up and drop projects as and when I please.<br><br>

  I recently met a guy from a new agency called Normally, comprised mainly of ex-Method and Ideo folk. They have a few simple rules: take on only projects that they actually want to work on (and say no a lot more, so they don’t need to hire too hard); be totally flexible in their work/life (they work 4 days a week, some take a Friday off, some take a Wednesday off, so they still have 100% client coverage). Their first projects were for Facebook and Microsoft, and they're getting startup exposure as a matter of course since their agency approach seems to gel nicely with &lsquo;startups&rsquo; (though FB nor MS are really startups!).
</p>

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>Has being independent enabled you to do the kind of work you want to do?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  I think so, but that’s only because I don’t know anyone who actually is doing the work I want to do. Its a strange feeling&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;being on the verge of dissatisfaction because of something nebulous and unattainable&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;but conversely if I feel I am doing all that I can, I’ll be pretty happy for the next few decades!
</p>

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>What would an agency / startup have to offer for you to come in from the cold and join them?<span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  *Really* good people, and a super nice physical environment (but with the flexibility to work from home). And I suppose the money would have to be very good, unless I truly believed in the company and was given an equity stake.<br><br>

  The only sorts of places who could match / better my current freelance income would be the super-funded companies in San Francisco. The thing is, that wouldn’t come with any uplift in quality of life, so they’d have to be based in London or New York.

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>Are you confident that agencies will continue to attract the best talent?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  It depends on location. Talent in San Francisco will always be attracted to the huge salaries tech has to offer (hence why agencies are closing-up there), whereas I think the best opportunities in London will be at agencies for a while to come. Client-side will always pay better and now often empowers creatives to do bigger and bolderD work, so agencies have their work cut out to make their roles attractive.
</p>
<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>With tech companies offering higher salaries and creative autonomy, what can agencies do to hold on to their best people?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  Some people love focusing on one project or product, making it the best it could ever be, while others (like myself, I think) like a variety of projects. I’d guess those people are fundamentally quite different so agencies need to play to those motivations: could agencies promise rotation between clients and types of projects?<br><br>

  The pain of working at agencies often comes from the ceaseless need to make revenue just to make ends meet, yet employees rarely see much benefit from trying to hit those targets. I’d guess a sort of shared-ownership/profiting-sharing scheme for the best people would go a long way to motivate them. That’d help engender the “collective” feel but without the difficulty. It’s a terrible comparison, but this is simply how banks hold on to their best people; the major part of their compensation is bonus-based.
</p>

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>Are you optimistic about the future of creative agencies?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  The nature of &ldquo;an agency&rdquo; won’t exist in the same way we understand it now. In the near future they will be quite loose affiliations of people joined with a common goal, and not necessarily in the same physical space. The tools to manage such organisations don’t exist yet, but they will. I think the likes of <a href="http://fictivekin.com/">Fictive Kin</a> are really interesting models for the future of the agency.<br><br>

  People talk about collectives as being the future of the agency, but the imbalance of individual’s effort vs money will always be a stumbling block, and I’m unsure how that can be overcome.
</p>

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>Do you believe agencies are equipped to deal with new client needs?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  From my experience, the vast number of design agencies are literally panicking trying to adapt to client demands. They often barely understand the internet and try to offer solutions learned from print communications which are often hopelessly inappropriate. On the flip side, there is huge upsides for any agencies who are digitally native, and truly “get” digital: a handful of agencies like Work&Co, Wondersauce, Gin Lane, and so on that are born of the internet, rather than a hangover of print or TV advertising.
</p>

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>Do you think agencies need to adapt their business models to stay relevant?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  I think so, since the larger companies are likely to bring more talent in-house, reducing the reliance on their incumbent agencies. The likes of Nike and Apple are doing this, and there is no reason other companies can’t start or acquire design practices.

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>Do you see yourself working in an agency in 3 years time?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  I think it’s quite unlikely that I’d ever join a traditional agency, and there are no agencies that I respect enough to want to trade in the freedom I have now (both in terms of time and financially).
</p>

<p class="container__inner text--question u-margin-Bl">
  <span>What’s next for you?</span>
</p>

<p class="container__inner u-margin-Bl">
  I have zero plans. The last time I had a plan it involved swanning off to San Francisco to join a big company that make watches, but I learned that wasn’t what I wanted to do when I went through the interview process. It’s best not to have a plan in this industry, unlike something like the law or finance where the paths are extremely clear and you need to beat a path to the top.
